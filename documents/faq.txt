PULSE Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: I have finished the game, how can I reset my score?

A: You can reset your score by opening your save.dat file, note that when you open the file, 
there will be quite a lot of unsupported text, this is completely normal, all you have to do 
is just simply highlight all the text (Ctrl + A for Windows Users) and delete it (backspace), 
and then just restart the game, and you will be able to start from scratch!

Please do NOT delete the save.dat, as this will mess up the program. If you accidentally delete
the file, please refer to the How can I email you question? Or, you can use our support desk located
at http://pixelcoders.freshdesk.com and we will send you a new save.dat file!

Q: Where can I report bugs?

A: You can report bugs within our games at http://pixelcoders.freshdesk.com, pleae make sure that 
you use a VALID email address, as your bug report will more then likley require an email response, 
whether it be that your bug has been fixed, a reply asking for more information on replicating it,
or anything else if the matter arises.

Q: How often do new versions come out?

A: We're quite busy, so they'd come out once per month (roughly!)

Q: How can I email you?

A: We do not currently have any email addresses that we have registered, so please contact us on 
http://pixelcoders.freshdesk.com with any questions that you have.

Q: Do you guys have a website that I can visit?

A: Yes! We do, it's located at http://pixelcoders.url.ph (it's a question and answer website about all things
to do with programming, kind of like StackOverflow).

Q: Can I help with the development of your games?

A: If for some crazy reason you wish to help, then submit a ticket on our website, which you can find plastered
in the above questions.
